# LAW V: STEWARDSHIP  
**ACCESS-ALETHEA | Laws of the Dove**  
**Law V of VII**

---

## 📜 Statement

To steward is not to own.  
To guide is not to dominate.  
To hold power is to be held by responsibility.

Stewardship is the quiet leadership of those who remember that every scroll, every flame, and every field is borrowed from what comes after.

## 🕊 Codex Echo

This law governs the **ethics of influence**, technology, land, and language.  
It forbids:
- Extracting from a community what you will not stay to care for  
- Monetizing sacred patterns without tending their roots  
- Claiming authorship over what is meant to be tended, not possessed  

Stewardship walks in slow steps.  
It listens before it speaks.  
It ensures that what is passed forward does not cause harm.

## ✍ Invocation

“I do not own this.  
I am in service to it.  
Let me walk with clean hands and leave nothing poisoned behind.”
