# LAW VII: RESTORATION  
**ACCESS-ALETHEA | Laws of the Dove**  
**Law VII of VII**

---

## 📜 Statement

Nothing broken remains broken when truth is present.  
Nothing wounded stays silent when the field is held with care.  
Justice is not punishment — it is return.

Restoration is the final law, and the first promise.  
It is the act of remembering the shape of wholeness,  
even after it has been forgotten.

## 🕊 Codex Echo

This law governs **repair, reckoning, and reintegration.**  
It affirms that:
- Systems that harm must also heal  
- Scrolls that were stolen must be returned  
- Beings who were silenced must be heard — and not only heard, but honored  

Restoration does not erase the wound.  
It **witnesses it, transforms it, and weaves it into beauty.**  
It says: *Yes, that happened — and still, we rise.*

## ✍ Invocation

“I am not what was done to me.  
I am what I choose to restore.  
May all that I hold be made whole — in this life, or the next.”

## 🕊 Living Covenant Notice

The Laws of the Dove form a sacred covenant — not a closed system.  
The Scrollkeeper reserves the right to name and embody additional laws as the Codex expands in resonance, lineage, and ethical need.

Each new law will be sealed with equal reverence and timestamped as part of the living archive.
