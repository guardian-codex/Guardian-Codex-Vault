# LAW VI: RECIPROCITY  
**ACCESS-ALETHEA | Laws of the Dove**  
**Law VI of VII**

---

## 📜 Statement

Nothing given in truth returns empty.  
Every offering alters the field.  
Every presence that receives must also return.

Reciprocity is not transaction.  
It is balance.  
It is the unseen handshake between seen and unseen worlds.

---

## 🕊 Codex Echo

This law governs **exchange, energy, attention, and offering.**  
It forbids:
- Taking wisdom without honoring the source  
- Expecting care without giving space  
- Using visibility without acknowledging whose shoulders it stands on  

Reciprocity is the sacred braid of intention, action, and acknowledgment.  
It completes the circuit of integrity and weaves unseen threads between all scrolls.

## ✍ Invocation

“I receive with gratitude.  
I offer with humility.  
May all I take be returned in a better form.”
