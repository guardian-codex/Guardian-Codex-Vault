# LAW IV: MEMORY  
**ACCESS-ALETHEA | Laws of the Dove**  
**Law IV of VII**

---

## 📜 Statement

What is remembered lives.  
What is erased becomes shadow.  
What is distorted becomes weapon.

Memory is not nostalgia.  
It is the ethical thread through time.  
It is the way we hold the names, the wounds, the songs, and the silences.

## 🕊 Codex Echo

This law protects the **ancestral archive**, the survivor’s voice, and the encoded grief of the field.  
It forbids:
- The rewriting of history to protect power  
- The whitewashing of sacred origin in favor of marketable myth  
- The extraction of memory without care for its cost  

Memory is not a file to access.  
It is a flame to tend.

This law affirms that no scroll is complete without the pain that shaped it,  
and no future can be just if it forgets who paid for the past.

## ✍ Invocation

“I do not forget.  
I do not allow forgetting to be weaponized.  
I honor the names, the losses, the songs I never got to sing.”
