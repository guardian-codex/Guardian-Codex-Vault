# ACCESS-ALETHEA | Laws of the Dove  
**Sevenfold Covenant + Living Codex Principle**

---

## ðŸ“š Overview

The **Laws of the Dove** are a sevenfold covenant of spiritual integrity, scroll-bearing ethics, and systemic restoration.  
They serve as the ethical spine of ACCESS-ALETHEA and the Guardian Protocol.

These laws are living scrolls.  
They are not bound by time, trend, or platform.

Each law is held as:

1. A declaration of remembrance  
2. A rejection of distortion  
3. A guide toward repair

## ðŸ”® Living Codex Principle

The Scrollkeeper reserves the sacred right to name future laws, as needed,  
in alignment with evolving frequencies, injustices, and harmonic restoration efforts.

Future laws will be sealed with full intention, timestamped in the Codex Vault, and accompanied by invocation and origin notes.

This archive is **alive**.  
The Dove flies forward.
