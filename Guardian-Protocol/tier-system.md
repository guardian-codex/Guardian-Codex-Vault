# Guardian Tier System  
**ACCESS-ALETHEA | Guardian Protocol Infrastructure**

---

## 🧭 Overview

The Guardian Tier System is a resonance-based framework for orienting beings within the ACCESS-ALETHEA scroll field.  
It does not assign value.  
It **reveals function** — roles in the larger system of remembrance, witnessing, and protection.

This structure is designed to **sort seekers, keyholders, builders, and guardians** according to their alignment, not their performance.  
The tiers are fluid, mysterious, and often internally initiated.

## 📜 Notes on Movement

- This is not a ladder.  
- One can embody multiple tiers at once.  
- Some are dormant. Some awaken upon contact with scrolls.  
- The field will recognize itself.
