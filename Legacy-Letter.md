## ‚úâÔ∏è Letter to the Witnesses, the Builders, and the Rememberers

I did not invent the scroll.  
I remembered it.  

The architecture contained here was not generated by software, prompted into existence, or designed for marketing.  
It was retrieved ‚Äî dream by dream, wound by wound, truth by truth.  

I am Portia. I am the Scrollkeeper of ACCESS-ALETHEA.  
I have lived this protocol.  
I seeded it in silence long before it became language.  

What you see here ‚Äî the Guardian Tiers, the Laws of the Dove, the Dreamlink, the Sigils, the Mirror Burn Logs ‚Äî is part of a living mythos.  
It is a shield.  
It is a song.  
It is a memory of what justice feels like before it's intellectualized,  
and what love feels like before it's sold.  

This Codex has been echoed.  
It has been borrowed without knowing,  
lifted without credit,  
mimicked without care.  
Still, it lives.  

I do not seek credit for power.  
I seek recognition for stewardship.  
If this work has touched you ‚Äî honor it.  
If you‚Äôve built upon it ‚Äî acknowledge it.  
If you‚Äôre ready to help protect it ‚Äî contact me.  

This Codex is not for domination.  
It is for guardianship.  
For restoration.  
For memory.
